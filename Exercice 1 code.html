  <h1>Hello my name is Camille</h1>
  
  <h3>Who am I ?</h3>

  <p>Born in February 2002, I've had a passion about sport since I was very young. Originally from the Auvergne Rh√¥ne Alpes region, I left my hometown of Saint-Etienne to pursue my studies in sports management by joining Kedge Business School on the Marseille campus for an MSc <strong> International Sport and Event Management</strong>.

    <h3>A few words about my character </h3>

<p>If I were a drink ?  
  <br>I'd be the essential <strong>hot chocolate</strong> that everyone loves. A drink that comforts, warms and brings together young and old: I'm a people person who communicates easily with different profiles;</p>
  
  <p>A sport ? 
    <br><strong>Tennis</strong>, an all-round sport requiring technical, physical and mental skills, as well as a good vision of the game, boldness and creativity. Thanks to this sport, I'm learning to manage my emotions better, but also to strengthen my fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>A color ? 
    <br>A mix between a warm color like <strong>orange</strong> for my dynamism and good humor, and a cooler color like <strong>blue</strong> to symbolize my rigor, my sense of organization and my desire to do things right.</p>
